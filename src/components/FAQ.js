            <p class="spellingbee-paragraph">
                The New York Times Spelling Bee is a daily word puzzle game that challenges players to form as many words as possible using a set of seven unique letters arranged in a honeycomb pattern. One of these letters is highlighted and must be included in every word formed. The goal is to find words of four or more letters, including the highlighted letter, to achieve various ranks such as "Solid," "Good," "Great," and "Amazing," with the ultimate goal of reaching the "Queen Bee" status by finding all possible words. Different words also give different amounts of points. Ideally you want to pick words that are as long as possible to score the most points. The scoring works by giving four letter words one point each. Then for each letter longer you get an additional point. So a five letter word would give you two points. This engaging puzzle tests your vocabulary, spelling skills, and creativity, providing a fun and stimulating mental exercise. The Spelling Bee has gained popularity due to its simplicity, yet challenging nature, and is enjoyed by word enthusiasts of all ages.

            <ul class="spellingbee-list">
                <li class="spellingbee-list-item"><strong>Start with the Central Letter:</strong> Since every word must include the central letter, begin by focusing on it and try to form as many words as possible around it.</li>
                <li class="spellingbee-list-item"><strong>Look for Common Prefixes and Suffixes:</strong> Identify common prefixes (like “re-,” “un-”) and suffixes (like “-ing,” “-ed”) that can help in forming words.</li>
                <li class="spellingbee-list-item"><strong>Use Plurals and Different Tenses:</strong> Check if adding an "s" to form plurals or changing the tense (like adding “-ed” or “-ing”) can create new words.</li>
                <li class="spellingbee-list-item"><strong>Think of Different Word Lengths:</strong> Don’t just focus on long words; sometimes shorter words can be easier to find and can add up quickly.</li>
                <li class="spellingbee-list-item"><strong>Mix and Match Letters:</strong> Experiment with different letter combinations to see what works, as sometimes unusual letter pairings can lead to surprising discoveries.</li>
                <li class="spellingbee-list-item"><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> If you get stuck, taking a break can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective when you return.</li>
